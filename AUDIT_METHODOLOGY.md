# Documentation Audit Methodology

This project evaluates Web3 documentation based on four key pillars of Developer Experience (DX). 

## 1. Navigability & Scannability (The PM Perspective)
* **Goal:** Can a developer find what they need in under 30 seconds?
* **Criteria:**
    * Consistent use of Headings (H1, H2, H3).
    * Functional Search bar.
    * Logical grouping of "Getting Started" vs. "API Reference."

## 2. Technical Accuracy & Freshness (The Writer Perspective)
* **Goal:** Is the code snippet up to date?
* **Criteria:**
    * Do the Faucet instructions match current rate limits?
    * Is the distinction between Devnet, Testnet, and Mainnet clear?
    * Are the CLI installation commands functional for all OS types?

## 3. The "Time-to-Hello-World" (The UX Perspective)
* **Goal:** How long does it take for a new user to complete their first transaction/contract?
* **Criteria:**
    * Identifying friction points in the "First Move Program."
    * Clarity on gas requirements and Object-centric architecture.

## 4. Linguistic Authority (The Quality Perspective)
* **Goal:** Does the tone inspire trust?
* **Criteria:**
    * Adherence to active voice.
    * Use of consistent terminology (e.g., "Objects" vs. "Assets").
    * Absence of "Just," "Simply," or "Easy" (terms that alienate struggling users).
